Get data on IP addresses. Learn where they are located (lat/long,
country, city, time zone), whether they are blacklisted or not (by
`abuseipdb <http://http://www.abuseipdb.com>`_,
`virustotal <http://www.virustotal.com>`_,
`ipvoid <http://ipvoid.com/>`_, etc.) and for what (and when they were
blacklisted), which ports are open, and what services are running (via
`shodan <http://shodan.io>`_), and what you get when you ping or issue
a traceroute.
